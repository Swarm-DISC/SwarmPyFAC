Usage
=====
The main part of interest belongs to the ``swarmpyfac.fac`` module. It is however recommended to import the package itself, as it will also import the modules in a fitting namespace::

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import swarmpyfac as fac
    >>> fac
    >>> fac.utils
    >>> fac.safety
